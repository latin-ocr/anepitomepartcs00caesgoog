RIVERS.

Ι. The Rhene, Rhodanus. This river rises from
a glacier, called, therefore, the thne Glacier, on
the Furca, and runs westwards down the valley
between the Bernese and Pennino Alps, but nearer
the Bernese. At A, it turne suddenly to the north,
round the base of the western extremity of the Ber-
nese Alps, and soon forms the Lake of Genevn,
Lacus Lemma, 55 miles long.

During this part of its course, the thne is tur-
bid and frothy, owing to its origin from under the
enow on the mountain eide. Its impuritiee, how·

· ever, subside in the Lake, from the S.W. extremity

of which, at B, it issues with a peculiar clear blue
colour. In the course of the first mile this clear-
nees is somewhat diminished by the Arve, which it
receives on the left, from the valley of Chamouny,
near the north base of Mont Blanc. After a semi-
circular sweep to S.W. and N .W., it runs due W.
to 2, and then turning due S. falls by several
mouths into the Mediterranean, at the Gulf of
Lions. It is the most rapid of the larger rivers iu
Europe. The following are its principal tribu-
taries below the Arve :—

1. (r) ⁴* Ain, from the north, receiving (r) the

Ar out.
2. (r) Th{ Saone, Arar, receiving (1), at E, the

· cr> right bank ; (1) 10st bank.
