About 50‘ miles from Maladetta, the monareh of
the Pyrenees, is Mont Perdu, st N, 10,950 st, and,
about 30 miles farther W. is the Pic du Midia·

VI. 'I'he Adour, Atur, Atiirus, or -νίε, rises on a
mountain immediately North of Mont Pei-dud· runs
with a sweep N ., N.W. and S.W., and falls due W.
into the Βῆ] of Biscay. It is fed by streame from

all the valleys of the Pyrenees which it passes.† Its ι

chief tributaries are :—

1. (1) The Gabss.

2. (r) 'Phe Midouze. ’

3. (1) Tge Gsve du Pau, receiving (1) the Gave

d' Ieron.

4. (1) The Nive.

Before proceeding farther, we may take a gene-
ral review of the great mountain chains ς and of the
numerous stresms that descend between them,
uniting as they proceed, till, by one great trunk,they
are discharged into the ocean, whence water is con-
tinually raised in vapour, to fall again in rain or

serve the bearings and the proportione of these
mountain and river systems‚ so as to be able, from
. memor-y, to sketch at least an outline of them on
elate or paper.

Besides the ridges already described, may be

' ⁴* Pio du Midi the Poak of uid-day, or the Soutlt. 'l'here
are others so calied 3—-one at the source of the Adour.

† 'rho like may bc said of all rivers that run along the
base of 'a ridge of mountains.
