rl'he rays of the sun melt the upper portion of
the snow 3 and the water runs down, or penetrate·
the mass, to be again frozen at night. The warmth
0f0the earth melts the under portion, and the water
descende as from an inexhaustible reservoir, irri-
gating the fields below, and supplying the surro'und-
ing countries with rivers.

Vast accumulatione of ice and snow, often many
miles in extent, and some hundred feet thick, move
bodily downwards from the higher Alps, at the
rate of some inches dailyst‘ As their extremitien
or margins reach the steeper declivities, messes oi
them break away, and are precipitated with a noise
like thunder‚ and a force that carries everything
before it,—buildings, woods, and rocks. These
falls are called avalamxheae. In some parts ava-
lanches are always occurringg in others they are
looked for chiefly in two seasons, which are winter,
from the increasing accumulation of snow, and
spring, from the commencement of thaw3 and in
these parts people are on their guard against the
consequences, which, notwithstanding, are some·
times most disastrouS.

The Alps are rugged towards the west, and pre
cipitous towards the east, and form a vast natural
barrier, which it was believed to require something
more than human courage and power-to be the first
to surmount. This honour is accordingly conferred

⁸ 'l'hese accumulatione are oaned qlam'en, and, in some
places, mere de ρῑαοε, οι· κω of ice- 'rho iee, however, is
not even and smooth, like ours 3 but, owing to its motion
over an unequal bottom, is broken into dangerous chasms,
and crushed into ridges, like frozen waves. The glaciem
altogether would cover an area of about 1500 square milon.
