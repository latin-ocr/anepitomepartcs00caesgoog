Map in that direction. To assist our ideas of dis-
tance in future descriptions, we may assume that a
straight line, from the lst to the 2d station, would
measure about 110 miles.

The 3d station stands west and southwards from
the lst, at the distance of about 240 mileS.

The 4th is near the middle of the range of
mountains that form ‘the southern boundary by land.
Not to multiply stations, let us suppose that the
whole gf the country mayr be seen from these four

oints. , ”
P Let us suppose ourselves to be standing at the
first station. It is on Mount St Gothard, Adina(
in the Alps, Alpes. Its highest peak is 10,900
feet above the level of the sea.† The Alps are
the greatest assemblage of mountains‡ in Europe,
nd they are also the highest. Elsewhere nature

grandeur. Far above the line of vegetation, rise
regions of perpetual snow 3 and above these shoot
up vast spires of bare and solid rock, to look down
upon the clouds.

“ The youngest pupil need hardly be inm-mod, that this
would be impossible in practice. A much greater number
of stations would be required for the aetual surrey of even
a small portion of suoh a country.

It will give some idea of this height to bear in mind that
the highest mountain in Britain is not nearly half so high ;
and yet St Gothard is not a high mountain for the Alps.
