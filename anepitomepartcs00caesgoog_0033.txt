'l'he mountain ridge, extending with a N.E. curve,
from the turn of the Rhssne, between B and the
junction of (1) the Ain, to the Rhine, at the junction
of (2) the Aar, is Mont Jura (Mons Jura). It is
180 miles long. On its N.W. side, you see the
Doubs running N.E.‚ and the Ain running S.W.;
and at the SE. base, the lakes of Genera, Neuf·

Mons Voseyus or Voylfm.

The chain runs northward for 170 miles, paral-

of the Maine and Nahe. Looking westward we
see a semicircular ridge separating the tributaries
of the Rhine from those of the Rhene, as far as 8.
From 8 it runs S.W. by Ε at 4 to D, and then S.

all the way, and terminates at A, on a stream run-
