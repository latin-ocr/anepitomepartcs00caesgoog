Here it crossed tlte Garumna to include the Tolo-

at the foot of the Maladetta, our fourth station.

of the other three parts, in the time of Caesar,
Gallia Belyica is divided from the rest Β] the
Sequana, from its mouth to the junction of the
Matrona, and thence Β] the Matrona, and, from its
source, by the curving watershed to Mont Ballou,
our second station, and onward to the northern ex-
tremityxof Mo‘nt J ura, and Rhenus, at its junction
with the Aar. Gallia Celtica, which Ooesar some-
times calls simply Gallia, is bounded on the N. Β]
the territories of the Belyoe, and on the south Β] the
Roman province, and the Garumna to its mouth.
Aquitania is bounded on the N. Β] the Garumna ,·-
on the E. Β] the Province ,- and on the S. Β] the
Pyrenea.

Observe that Caesar has included the Helvetii
among the Galli or Gelae? though they are gene-
rally spoken of Β] themselves. Their boundaries,
as seen from our station, were, on the E„ a line fol-
lowing the watershed between the sources of the
Rhene and of the Reuss, continued between the Val-
ley qf the Reuss, and that of the Linth or Limthal,
